Why did the scarecrow win an award? Because he was outstanding in his field!

A dog says to a tree, "You know, I really don't like it when you wave your branches around. It makes me feel like you're trying to talk to me."

The tree apologized and said, "Look, I didn't mean to offend you. It's just that my leaves keep dying and falling off. I guess I get lonely and miss the conversation."

"That's OK," said the dog. "We dogs get lonely too. Just come with me sometime when I walk by the pond. The ducks quack, the geese honk, the swans swim around looking elegant, and we have a grand old time talking to each other!"

And so the tree went off to the pond to see if he could learn something from the ducks about having a conversation.

The next day the dog walked past the pond and saw his friend, the tree.

"Hey there, don't you look happy," said the dog. "Where did you learn to talk like that?"

"I met some ducks at the pond yesterday," said the tree. "They taught me everything I know."

"You mean they could really talk!" exclaimed the dog.

"Of course!" replied the tree. "The geese were keeping quiet as usual, but the ducks sure could chatter!"

And that's why a tree can learn to talk, but a duck can't.

A man walks into a pet shop and sees a parrot sitting on a perch. The parrot looks very intelligent and the man asks him "Can I buy you?" The parrot responds with:
"I don’t think so!"
The man asks: "What do you mean by that?"
The parrot answers: "You see that beautiful bird in the other cage? She's a singing bird. When I first arrived at this shop, the owner told me that if I could teach that bird to talk, he would let me go free."

"So what happened?" the man asked.

"Well," said the parrot, "I haven't exactly given up hope yet!"

There are three runners who all enter a race, but each has his own unique condition. The first runner is the fastest in the world, but he is deaf. The second runner is blind, and the third runner is lame. They all start at the same time, with a single prize waiting for the winner of the race.

As they run down the track, it quickly becomes apparent who will be winning the race. It is the fastest runner who quickly gains a large lead on the other two contestants. He looks back and sees the blind runner falling further and further behind. Wanting to give the second runner a chance to win, he picks up a loud whistle from the side of the track and tosses it to the blind man.

The blind runner picks up the whistle and quickly begins blowing it as loud as he can. With each blast of the whistle, the lame runner in last place hears it and takes a step forward, stepping on the head of the blind runner with each move.

By the time they reach the finish line, the blind runner has taken first place by one step over the other two contestants, even though everyone knew that he was in last place to start with.

When asked how he had done it, the blind runner explained: "Well, you see I couldn't see where I was going, so I just kept stepping on whoever was between me and the finish line."

And that is why they say, "Even if you are out of step, you can still be in first place if no one else knows the music.

There are three old farmers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob who have decided to retire to Florida. They find a beautiful three-bedroom house with a swimming pool and everything for $300,000.

One day at the beach, they see a gorgeous blonde woman walking towards them. She asks what they are doing, and they say "We're looking for a place to retire."

"Well," she says, "I'm selling my house in Florida and I could use some help with my price of $300,000. Would you like it?"

They said "Sure!" and the next week they're all settled into their new home when there's a knock on the door. It's the blonde, looking very attractive and with a suitcase in her hand.

"Hello," she says. "I noticed you're moving in, so I came by to say hello and welcome you to the neighborhood."

She walks into the house and they all look at each other and shrug their shoulders - free rent!

Then she drops her suitcase and bends over to pick it up. At that moment, three pairs of old eyes almost pop out of their heads in unison. They had just struck gold!

The next day, the blonde comes back with another suitcase - again dropping it and bending over to pick it up.

Abraham says "Quick, quick, let's get that golden ticket!"

They call the ticket company and order three tickets for the Florida lottery at $10 each, totaling $300.

That night, they sit in their easy chairs watching the evening news on television and wishfully dreaming of all the good things to come.

The newscaster says, "Finally we have some good news! A couple from Florida just won the Florida lottery with these golden tickets!"

Abraham jumps up and screams "I told you I had a feeling!"

Then they see the blonde on TV being interviewed. She was the couple who had won the lottery, and she said to the newscaster "I've always wanted a house in Florida, but never thought it would come with three old men."

And so the moral of the story is: Always have good neighbors!

Three women, Anna, Bella and Caroline, were having coffee. They start talking about their husbands, as women do.

Anna says, "My husband bought me a lovely ring for our anniversary. It cost him a month's salary."

Bella says, "Mine isn't as expensive, but it has sentimental value. My husband gave it to me on our wedding day - his mother's wedding ring."

Caroline said, "Well, mine is neither as costly nor does it have any sentimental value at all. It was bought at Walmart and cost $5."

The other two women are astonished. They asked, "Why did you spend so little on your anniversary present?"

"Because I don't know my husband's size," replied Caroline.

A man is on his death bed and is being visited by family and friends. One visitor is his best friend for many years and he has always had a lot of respect for him. The best friend gets very close to the dying man and gives him a gentle kiss on the forehead. The man's wife turns bright red, glares at her husband and says "I never knew you liked boys that way".

A father asked his son: "So, have you ever told your mother how much you love her?"
The son replied: "Of course I have! There isn’t a day that goes by when I don't tell mum how much I love her!"
The father was pleased and said, "I wish I could say the same thing."
"Well," said the son with a grin, "you're sure talking about it a lot today!"

While sitting on a park bench, a woman noticed a man with a very odd-looking hat. The hat had lights, bells, and whistles all over it. It was quite a spectacle!

The woman couldn’t help but ask the man what made him wear such a wild hat.

"I’m in sales," he replied. "And my job is to sell light bulbs."

A father was driving with his young son when the boy asked, “Dad, how did you meet mom?”

The dad said, “Well, we were both at a friend’s wedding and we danced together all night.”

The boy thought about that for a moment and then asked, “Did you take her home after the wedding?”

“No,” the father answered.

The boy said, “Did someone else take her home?”

“No,” replied the father again.

The boy thought some more and then asked, “Then how did you get mom to like you enough to be my mother?”

A little boy walks up to his father and says, "Dad, I found these two pigeons in the park, and one of them is white and the other one is grey."

The father looks at the boy and asks, "And what do you think that makes?"

"I don't know," answers the boy. "But my friend says it's a penguin!"

An elderly lady had just moved into a nursing home. After she was all settled in, she called her daughter to tell her about the place. She said: “I’m glad I’m here. The food is good and I have everything I need.”

Then she said: “I just wish I had a cat.”

A few days later, the daughter received another phone call from her mother.

“I really want a cat,” the elderly lady told her.

“Mom, you’re 85 years old and you live in a nursing home,” her daughter replied. “What do you need a cat for?”

“Well, they tell me that if I get a cat, I will be so happy and content here.”

Her daughter agreed to see what she could do about getting her mother a cat.

A few days later the daughter returned for another visit. She brought with her a lovely Siamese kitten for her mother. The old lady was very pleased and immediately started petting the kitten, cooing and playing with it.

Her daughter asked: “So are you happy now, mom?”

“Oh yes,” her mother replied. “But there’s something I don’t understand – why doesn’t the little cat like me? He always runs away from me!”

A man was walking through a pet store with his wife. His wife told him that she wanted to get their son a puppy for Christmas.

The man said, "I don't think we should get a dog. They're a lot of work and I don’t think we have time to take care of one."

But the woman insisted: “We’ll make time. We can’t let our son not have a puppy.”

The next day they went back to the pet store and told the owner that they wanted to get a dog for their son. The owner asked them, "What kind of dog would you like?"

The man said “Well, we want a big dog, but we also want it to be intelligent.”

The owner replied: "I have just the right dog for you! I have this beautiful Great Dane who is very large and very smart. In fact, he's so smart that he can do everything for himself."

So the couple bought the Great Dane, took him home, and introduced him to their son. The boy was ecstatic to have a new dog!

At first, everything was great. But then things started going wrong. Their son began to notice that the Great Dane never came when he was called. Also, the dog never seemed to be hungry, so they would never ask for food. He didn’t need to go outside either - the dog did it all himself!

They finally figured out what was happening: The Great Dane had been lying about everything and didn't actually do anything for himself at all.

So they decided that their son needed a new dog after all. They returned to the pet store and told the owner their problem with the Great Dane.

The owner said, “I have just the right dog for you! I have this beautiful German Shepherd who is very large and very smart.”

The couple asked, “How do we know that this dog isn’t going to lie about everything like our last dog?”

The owner replied: "Just watch. As soon as you get home, ask your new dog to sit."

So they took the German Shepherd home and asked him to sit. The dog did it immediately!

Then they asked the dog to roll over. Again, he did it perfectly on command.

The couple was thrilled with their smart new dog and felt that this time things would work out.

Two weeks later, they came back to see the owner and said: “Our German Shepherd can sit, lie down, roll over, fetch, stay, dance, you name it! He does everything!”

The pet store owner replied: "That's great! Now have you taught him to do his own laundry yet?”

A woman was walking through the park one day when she saw a beautiful woman sitting on a bench.

She asked her what she did for a living, and the woman responded that she was an actress.

“Oh really?” said the first woman. “What are you starring in now?”

The actress answered: “I’m starring in a movie called ‘Four Women.' It opens next week.”

“How exciting!” said the first woman, and then she asked about the four women.

“The four women in the movie are me, my sister, my mother, and my grandmother,” replied the actress.

On the opening night of the film, the first woman's son went to see it with her. They found the movie to be quite enjoyable, and at one point the son turned to his mother and said: “You know, I never realized how pretty you were!

The mother replied: “That’s because there are only three women in this movie.”

A man goes into a pet shop and sees three parrots. He buys two of them, but the third one is too expensive so he decides to take it home anyway without paying for it.

On his way out of the store, he gets caught by the owner who asks him why he didn't pay for the third parrot.

The man says: "Well, I wanted two parrots but couldn't afford the third one so I just took it home."

The shopkeeper says: “That’s fine, you can pay me back later.”

The next day the man returns and pays for the third parrot.

A few days later he goes back to buy another one, but this time when he gets outside he sees that the shop owner is waiting for him with a gun in his hand.

“What’s going on?” says the customer nervously.

The shopkeeper replies: “You see, when you took my parrot yesterday I thought it was stolen from me."

"But why did you let me take it?" asks the man, puzzled.

The shopkeeper answers: "Because I realized that if you were stealing my parrots, then they must be worth something.”

A man is walking down a street when he spots three birds on a telephone wire - two pigeons and an eagle.

He asks the two pigeons: “Why are you here with the eagle?”

They reply in unison: “We’re not really sure, but we heard it was cheaper than flying.”

A man is visiting his old college friend, who now has a teenage daughter. The man remarks on how beautiful she looks and asks if he can have her phone number.

The friend replies: “She doesn't need to know that I told you she had such nice legs, but please don’t tell her mom either.”

A woman walks into the pet store one day and finds three kittens sitting on a shelf. They are all curled up, sleeping soundly.

The first kitten wakes up and looks at the lady. She says, "Meow!" The second kitten also wakes up and stares at her. He says, "Meow!"

Then the third kitten opens his eyes, takes a look at the woman, and says, “Well?”

A couple decided to adopt a child and went to an orphanage in China. They were shown around by the director of the orphanage, who showed them a cute little Chinese boy named Li Wan-Kai.

The director said: "This child is very special. When he was born, his mother couldn't afford a hospital fee so she abandoned him under a tree where I found him."

The couple asked about his health history, but the director had no information about it. The couple didn’t mind and decided to take Li Wan-Kai with them on their way back home.

Two years later they returned to China for an adoption check-up visit.

Upon arrival at the orphanage, the couple was escorted straight to Li Wan-Kai's room. The boy seemed happy to see them and excitedly ran towards them while calling out: "Mommy, daddy! Look what I learned!"

He pointed towards a tree outside his window and said: “I am growing coconuts!”

A man and his wife were driving along the freeway when they saw a woman walking on the side of the road. Her clothes were torn and dirty, and she seemed to be in terrible shape.

The man asked his wife if she should give her some money, but his wife said: “No way! She looks like she’s been drinking all night and that’s how she ended up here."

But the man couldn't stand seeing someone so desperate, so he pulled over and got out of the car. He approached the woman and handed her a $20 bill.

"Here," he said, "I hope this helps you."

The woman looked at him gratefully and replied: “Oh thank you so much! I will use it for food and shelter."

The man walked back to his car with a smile on his face, proud of himself for helping someone in need.

As he got into the driver’s seat, his wife said: "You see? She is drunk!"

"How can you tell?" asked the man.

His wife replied: "She used her money for food and shelter instead of more drinks."

A blind woman was walking down a street in Manhattan when she suddenly fell into a hole. A passerby heard her scream and ran to help her.

The passerby asked the blind woman, “What happened?”

The woman replied: "I don’t know, but I can see Moscow from here!”

A woman walked into a pet shop and asked the owner if he had any parrots for sale.

"Yes," said the owner. "We have some in the back room. Follow me."

When they got to the back, there were many cages with birds inside them. Each bird was calling out something different: "I love you!", "You’re beautiful!" and so on.

The woman asked: “How do I know which one to choose?"

The owner replied: “Well, some of these are very expensive. But if you want to save money, I recommend this cheap little bird in the corner over there."

"Why is that bird so cheap?"

"Because it only says 'F%$# off!'"

A man was walking through the park one day when he saw a little girl sitting on a bench with her mother.

The little girl looked very sad, so the man asked her: “What's wrong?”

She said: "I lost my teddy bear and I'm really upset about it."

The man then reached into his pocket and pulled out a $20 bill. He handed it to the girl’s mother and told her: "Please take your daughter to the toy store and buy her another teddy bear.”

He continued walking until he came across two more girls sitting on another bench. Both of them were crying too.

“What's wrong?" he asked.

They replied in unison: “We lost our teddy bears!”

The man reached into his pocket again and handed each girl $20 bills to buy new teddy bears.

Then he continued walking until he saw three more girls sitting on yet another bench, also crying.

"What's wrong now?" he asked.

They replied: “We lost our teddy bears!"

The man reached into his pocket one last time and handed each girl $20 bills to buy new teddy bears too.

Feeling satisfied with himself, the man walked away.

A little while later, he came across a woman sitting on a bench with her dog. The dog looked very sad and depressed.

The man asked the woman: “Why is your dog so sad?”

The woman answered: “He lost his teddy bear.”

The man said: “Don't worry! I have one more $20 bill left in my pocket."

But before he could give it to her, she looked at him and said: "You know what? My dog doesn’t need a teddy bear. He needs a home!”

A man was walking through the park when he saw three dogs sitting on a bench.

He asked them: “Why are you all here together?”

The first dog replied: “I'm waiting for my owner to pick me up after school."

The second dog said: "My owner works nearby and we meet here every day.”

Finally, the third dog said: "Well, my owner lives in this park. I live here too!"

A man walked into a pet store one day and saw three parrots for sale. They were all full-grown and very beautiful.

He asked the store owner which was the cheapest of them. The owner said that they were all the same price, $50 each.

The man asked: “How come you have such well-behaved birds?”

The owner replied: "Well, I just give them whatever they ask for.”

A woman had just won a large sum of money in the lottery. She decided to donate part of her winnings to a local church.

She asked the pastor if he knew anyone who needed financial help, and he recommended a single mother with four children.

The woman made an appointment to meet the mother, but when she arrived at her home, she found out that the kids were all very sick. She offered to pay for their medical bills instead.

A few weeks later, the woman received a call from the mother thanking her for her generous gift. The mother said: “You saved my children’s lives.”

The woman replied: "Well, I didn't really do anything. God just used me as an instrument."

A man walked into a pet shop one day and saw three kittens sitting on a shelf. He asked the owner if he could buy all of them.

The owner said: “Sure! But how will you take care of them?”

“Don't worry,” said the man, “I have a big house with plenty of room for all of them.”

“Great!” replied the owner. “But there’s something else you should know about these kittens.”

The man asked: "What's that?"

"They are trained to be burglars," explained the owner.

“No problem,” said the man, “I can handle that.”

A man is driving through a remote part of Kentucky when he sees a sign saying "Best Fried Chicken and Biscuits 10 Miles". The man is hungry so he decides to stop at this restaurant. After eating his meal, the man goes to pay but the owner says "No worries buddy, your bill is already paid for."

The man leaves feeling very happy that someone had decided to be kind to a stranger and do something so generous.

A few days later the same thing happens again at another restaurant in the area. The owner pays his bill and tells him that it's already been taken care of.

Then on the third day, this man walks into yet another restaurant where the owner says "Sir, you don't have to pay for anything today."

The man asks "Why are all these people being so generous to me?"

And the waiter responds: "Well sir, you see, we have a new policy here. All customers who visit us on their wedding day or anniversary get their meals paid for free!"

A lady walks into a pet store and sees three birds sitting in cages. She asks the salesperson which one is the most expensive bird.
